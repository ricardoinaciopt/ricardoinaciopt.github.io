            <p>We tend, as humans, to <strong>hope</strong>, to have some sort of belief based entirely on a desire for
                things
                to be better. We get anxious with the many challenges life throws at us, and most of the time, we
                <strong>hope</strong> that everything goes as predicted, the so-called &quot;best case scenario&quot;.
                It's also
                interesting to note that even though we understand well that this <strong>hope</strong> in nothing
                increases our
                chances of success, there is something about it that makes us want to hang on to it, even if it is the
                last
                thing we do, because, as the saying goes:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;Hope is the last thing that dies in man&quot;<br>
                    <sub> - François de La Rochefoucauld </sub>
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We hope based on the premise that this world operates logically and under some set of predetermined rules
                that we
                can predict and use to our advantage, becoming, then, masters of our fate. But if we stop to think about
                it,
                this couldn't be more incorrect, as chaos, disasters, and unpredictable and unexplainable events happen
                daily,
                which sometimes can shake our views of the world to the core.<br>
                Looking at our reality this way, we quickly realize that we are only limiting ourselves if we keep on
                <strong>“hoping”</strong> away from our lives. We try to come up with reasonable ways to deal with
                everything
                that happens to us or others when reason won't work, solemnity because our world is not reasonable.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>To be reasonable is unreasonable.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If only we could take the <strong>“hope”</strong> factor out of the way, in a sense, most of our problems
                would
                be solved. To be truly free, we should not <strong>hope</strong> for a better future, instead, we should
                work on
                a better present, living our lives in a way that we always prioritize the moment.<br>
                Without the expectancy of a supreme reward, we would be able to be truly free, where long-term and
                hard-to-achieve end-goals, would become short-termed and realistically achievable ones. This way, we
                would not
                only be boosting our general happiness but also lifting away some weight and pressure we put upon
                ourselves to
                become versions we idolize and wish to become, without even considering if it is achievable.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dreams and life goals are important to motivate us to be better versions of ourselves, so obviously,
                getting rid
                of them entirely would not be a reasonable decision, because the same problem would persist, but instead
                of
                being discouraged by our failure and shortcomings, it would be by the mesmerizing emptiness not having
                goals or
                even a reason to live presents us.<br>
                By facing life with some sense of rebellion, where one does not simply accept what the so-called destiny
                presents him (being that positive or negative to the individual in question), but instead, it tries to
                constantly change its situation to be truly present in the world.<br>
                It is by learning with every single experience that we, as humans go through, that we can, as I said
                before, be
                present in this life, even if it brings us momentary discomfort or pain because those &quot;bad&quot;
                feelings
                are exactly what tells us about our presence, in the present, and avoiding them (or trying only to have
                &quot;good&quot; experiences), we would be accepting our weaknesses and as a consequence of that, we
                would be
                losing our <strong>freedom</strong>.<br>
                So to be truly free of this need for <strong>hope</strong>, one should simply forget about it! By
                removing the
                pressure of the &quot;best-case scenario&quot;, it is possible to realize that every possible outcome
                counts as
                an experience that emphasizes our presence in this world, and consequently, in this life.</p>
